/*Colors
------

I had intended to use colored tags.
The color was generated by of the tag's name and mapping it
to a color domain of sensible names, which I took from semantic ui.
The colors matched nicely, but the design was too noisey.
The colors are still generated, but the colors aren't used.
I would like to keep this here for later consumption.
I don't feel like I can let this idea die yet, although the tags aren't
used at the moment.
